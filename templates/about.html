The Cornell Maker Association (CMA) was originally conceived as a university-wide, cross-disciplinary initiative to foster innovation and creativity in the Cornell community. Founded by six undergraduates in the Engineering Leadership Program, CMA was created with the intention of providing Cornell students with the necessary resources to work on projects outside of their normal academic environment. As a way to support student innovation, CMA seeks to streamline access to engineering project supplies in a collaborative, friendly environment, known as the Makerspace. Through its online platform, CMA is able to connect students with peers who are eager to collaborate on engineering projects, providing valuable learning opportunities for members of the Cornell community.

Underneath Carpenter Library is the Cornell Makerspace, a large lab generously provided by professor Dave Schneider of the Systems Engineering department. The first of its kind at the university, the Makerspace shares its home with the project teams Cornell University Sustainable Design (CUSD) and Cornell Cup. CMA plans to use this unique space as its base for holding events, hosting talks and workshops, and allowing students to develop innovative projects that will be accessible to the entire Cornell community through our online sharing platform.

The members of our leadership team serve as spokespersons of the Maker Movement -- a DIY, technology-based culture of people who enjoy making things for both personal and often educational reward. As a team that understands the value of exercising oneâ€™s creativity, the CMA seeks to empower students to effect meaningful change through innovation while also encouraging STEM education.
